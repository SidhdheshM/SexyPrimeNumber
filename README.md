# SexyPrimeNumber
Write a C code to find out the following in given two numbers:
1. Sexy prime number pair
2. Sexy prime number triplet
3. Sexy prime number quadruplet
4. Sexy prime number quintuplet


What is Sexy Prime Number?
Sexy primes are prime numbers that differ from each other by 6. For example, the numbers 5 and 11 are both sexy primes, because 11-5=6

Types of groupings
1.  Sexy prime pairs:
    The sexy primes (sequences OEIS: A023201 and OEIS: A046117 in OEIS) below 500 are:

(5,11), (7,13), (11,17), (13,19), (17,23), (23,29), (31,37), (37,43), (41,47), (47,53), (53,59), (61,67), (67,73), (73,79), (83,89), (97,103), (101,107), (103,109), (107,113), (131,137), (151,157), (157,163), (167,173), (173,179), (191,197), (193,199), (223,229), (227,233), (233,239), (251,257), (257,263), (263,269), (271,277), (277,283), (307,313), (311,317), (331,337), (347,353), (353,359), (367,373), (373,379), (383,389), (433,439), (443,449), (457,463), (461,467).
As of April 2019, the largest known pair of sexy primes was found by S. Batalov and has 31,002 digits. The primes are:

(p, p+6) = (187983281 × 251478 + 4)×(5 × 251478 - 1) + 2 {\displaystyle \pm } \pm  3.[1]


2. Sexy prime triplets:
Sexy primes can be extended to larger constellations. Triplets of primes (p, p + 6, p + 12) such that p + 18 is composite are called sexy prime triplets. Those below 1000 are (OEIS: A046118, OEIS: A046119, OEIS: A046120):

(7,13,19), (17,23,29), (31,37,43), (47,53,59), (67,73,79), (97,103,109), (101,107,113), (151,157,163), (167,173,179), (227,233,239), (257,263,269), (271,277,283), (347,353,359), (367,373,379), (557,563,569), (587,593,599), (607,613,619), (647,653,659), (727,733,739), (941,947,953), (971,977,983).
As of 2019 the largest known sexy prime triplet, found by Peter Kaiser had 6031 digits:

    p = 10409207693*2^20000-1.[2]

3.  Sexy prime quadruplets:
Sexy prime quadruplets (p, p + 6, p + 12, p + 18) can only begin with primes ending in a 1 in their decimal representation (except for the quadruplet with p = 5). The sexy prime quadruplets below 1000 are (OEIS: A023271, OEIS: A046122, OEIS: A046123, OEIS: A046124):

(5,11,17,23), (11,17,23,29), (41,47,53,59), (61,67,73,79), (251,257,263,269), (601,607,613,619), (641,647,653,659).
In November 2005 the largest known sexy prime quadruplet, found by Jens Kruse Andersen had 1002 digits:

p = 411784973 · 2347# + 3301.[3]
In September 2010 Ken Davis announced a 1004-digit quadruplet with p = 23333 + 1582534968299.[4]

In May 2019 Marek Hubal announced a 1138-digit quadruplet with p = 1567237911*2677# + 3301 + 6*n.[5]

In June 2019 Peter Kaiser announced a 1534-digit quadruplet with p = 19299420002127 * 25050 + 17233 + 6*n

4.  Sexy prime quintuplets:
In an arithmetic progression of five terms with common difference 6, one of the terms must be divisible by 5, because 5 and 6 are relatively prime. Thus, the only sexy prime quintuplet is (5,11,17,23,29); no longer sequence of sexy primes is possible.
